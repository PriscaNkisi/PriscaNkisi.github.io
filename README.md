Hello there!
 
This repository consists of my Twine narrative on Tudor History. Specifically, this story revolves around the prominent King Henry VIII and his six wives. Following a non-linear Twine narrative with 30 passages, where the user chooses their own journey through a historical moment, one timeline is accurate, and the others are counterfactual. Throughout this adventure, one can choose and experience the life of one of Henry VIII's wives before and after marriage. This story contains illustrations of the wives' appearances along with assigned colored passages. The user is exposed to different scenarios and consequences based on the choices they make. Overall, with the inclusion of diverse visual components, designed texts, conditionals, variables, and user inputs, this is an educational project that allows users to expand their perspective while learning more about Tudor History. 

Be prepared to choose your own adventure! Bon voyage!
