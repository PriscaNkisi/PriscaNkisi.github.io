:: Accept to divorce the king {"position":"725,775","size":"100,100"}
You were offered a divorce along with a generous allowance of houses of your own and a prominent position as the Queen's sister. This spared you from  having to return to Cleaves as a failure and was far better than losing your head. 

You wisely accepted and sent Henry a letter along with your wedding ring which you asked him to break into pieces as it was a thing of no value. For his part in the failed marriage, Thomas Cromwell was beheaded and you retired to your country estates but was a frequent guest at court and became friends with her royal ex-husband. 

You were close with his daughters Mary and Elizabeth I and was a part of Mary's coronation procession years later. You learned English and made yourself at home in your new country. In 1557, at the age of 42, you died from cancer outliving Henry and all his other wives.

:: AnneBoleynStory {"position":"250,500","size":"100,100"}
Anne Boleyn's life was marked by intelligence and influence, but it ended in tragedy during the English Reformation. 

You were the daughter of Thomas Bellin, 1st Earl of Wiltshire and lady Elizabeth Howard. Your father was a talented diplomat and was sent to the holy Roman Empire as an ambassador. The emperor's daughter, Margaret of Austria, offered you a position as lady in waiting to the Netherlands. There, you were so presentable and so pleasant considering your youthful age. Later, you were sent to France to attend the first court of Henry VIII's sister. You lived at the sophisticated French court for seven years where you  gained knowledge of dance, fashion, music, poetry, and the flirtatious art of courtly love.

At 21, you were called back to your homeland for an arranged marriage to an Irish cousin, James Butler, but that fell through. Instead, you became a lady in waiting for queen Catherine of Aragon. Physically, you had dark hair and eyes, olive skin and a slender figure with decent looks, but your beauty lay in your dazzling wit and humor. You  popularized wearing the French style of headdress. 

As you caught the eye of King Henry, you convinced Henry to leave Catherine and to make you queen of England. However, the marriage annulment took seven years of legal battles with Catherine and unconsummated courtship with you. 

In the meantime, you were frustrated as you were approaching 30 and might not be able to carry a child. What did you decide to do?

:: AnneClevesStory {"position":"675,400","size":"100,100"}
Your short marriage to Henry left a lasting impact on the Tudor court.

You were born in Dusseldorf to the Duke and Duchess John III and Maria of Cleves.
You received no formal education and had little in the way of cultural sophistication, you could read and write only a little and only in German. 

After your father's death and your brother William became Duke, Cleves was a Protestant German state and opposed the holy Roman Empire, therefore, an alliance with England made sense. 

Artist Hans Holbein was dispatched to paint your portrait along with your younger sister's, Amelia so that Henry could look you two over. 

Henry became infatuated with your demure blonde slim and tall young woman. He sent his chief minister Thomas Cromwell to negotiate the match on New Year's Day, 1540. 

When you arrived in England, Henry decided to surprise you by disguising himself as a peasant. In this portly game of love, he was sure that you would fall in love with him on site, but you were shocked rather than enamored with the old overweight stranger who burst in on you. Henry was humiliated, he complained that it was you who was ugly and that Cromwell had lied to him about your beauty. 

He urged Cromwell to get him out of the marriage but doing so would endanger the German alliance. On your wedding night, Henry kissed you goodnight and went to sleep, but he railed at Cromwell the next morning that your body was so disordered that he was unable to consummate the marriage but you had no idea that the couple hadn't fulfilled your marital duties.

You were proud of having risen from the backwater of Cleaves to become queen of one of the most important countries in Europe. 

To prove he was not impotent, Henry soon found his way to the bed of your lady in waiting,Catherine Howard, and found legal grounds on which to divorce you without breaking the contract with Cleaves.

Your father's sister, Elizabeth Howard, was the mother of Anne Boleyn, making you a first cousin to the disgraced and beheaded queen. Though the family had a noble pedigree, your father had been one of 21 children and had inherited very little money. 

When you were five, your mother died. You and some of your siblings were sent to live with your father's stepmother Agnes Howard Dowager, Duchess of Norfolk. The Duchess 's household included many children of poor relations sent to her for care and education, but the Duchess was often away at court and gave very little supervision to the upbringing of her wards, some of the girls in the household allowed men into the dormitory at night, and the girls were rewarded with wine and gifts.

Your uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, saw an opportunity to increase his power by filling the King's bed. He found you a prestigious place as lady in waiting for Queen Anne of Cleaves and put you in Henry's view. You were vivacious and good humored, you loved dancing and had a great tenderness for animals, especially dogs. 

Henry was seen repeatedly going to your chambers less than three weeks after his divorce. You and Henry were married and enjoyed a 10 day honeymoon. The king called you the very jewel of womanhood and his rose without a thorn. He lavished you with clothes, jewelry and estates and longed to fulfill your every desire, he also promoted your uncle, the Duke of Norfolk and many other Howard men. 

Henry was hopeful for a pregnancy and was ready to crown you queen upon that condition. While Henry was besotted, you were carrying out a secret love affair with your husband's favorite courtier, Thomas Culpepper. Eventually, evidence of the same reached  Henry. At first he didn't want to believe it,  he wanted you to be innocent but your old love , Francis Durham, confessed out of torture.

Parliament passed a new law making it treason for a queen consort to fail to disclose her sexual history to the king within 20 days of their marriage, retroactively sealing your state. You were arrested right away. Your current and former lovers Culpepper and Dearham were both executed. 

The axeman took off your head in one clean stroke and you were buried in the tower of London's Chapel near your cousin Anne Boleyn.

Catherine Parr's legacy goes beyond her marriage to Henry, as she left an indelible mark on the history of England.

You were the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Parr, a member of a prominent northern family, and a lady in waiting for Henry's first wife Catherine of Aragon. 
You were named after the Spanish queen who was your godmother. 

Queen Catherine of Aragon encouraged women's education and you had a passion for learning. You spoke several languages fluently and enjoyed reading and writing but hated needlework. At 17, you married Sir Edward Burke who was in his 20s but was a sick man. He died four years into your marriage. 
At 22 year old, you married John Neville Baron Lattimer who was twice your age but your couple got unwell. When King Henry broke with Rome to divorce Catherine of Aragon, Catholics in the north of England rebelled against the king. The rebels came to the Lattimer home and threatened violence if John did not join their efforts. You watched in horror as your husband was dragged away and the house was ransacked of food and supplies. You and your young step children spent the winter held hostage by the rebels and threatened with death.

Eventually, the rebels were defeated and John returned home. Your family put their nightmare behind them by moving to London. After eight years of marriage, John's health was fading. You chose to nurse your husband until his death. He left you a wealthy woman but without him, you  had no place at court and dreaded returning North, so you sought out a friendship with the daughter of your mother's mistress, Princess Mary, and were given a place in her entourage. 

You ultimately fell in love with Sir Thomas Seymour, brother of the late queen Jane and you planned to wed but around this time you caught the eye of Henry. The king find you mature and so different from his latest disappointment. 

When Henry proposed marriage, Catherine were heartbroken and wanted a quiet marriage to Thomas Seymour and had no ambitions to be queen, but you had little choice but to accept and marry the king.

You were an excellent ruler and enormously influenced your stepdaughter Elizabeth the future queen.

In 1547, after four years of marriage to you and 38 years on the throne, Henry, bloated and riddled with disease, died. He was 55. The king was laid to rest in Saint George's Chapel at Windsor Castle next to his third wife Jane Seymour, the only wife he didn't live long enough to piss him off. He left you a fabulously wealthy woman but your heart's desire was Thomas Seymour. You both  knew that the Regency council would not allow her to marry so soon after the King's death so you wed in a secret ceremony. When the news of the marriage became public, it caused a scandal and infuriated your royal stepchildren. 

You became the first woman in England to publish under your own name. At 35 you became pregnant, a complete surprise as you had never conceived during your three previous marriages.

In August 1548, you gave birth to a daughter Mary but six days later, you died from childbed fever caused by poor hygiene during the delivery. Your ex-lover, Thomas Seymour was beheaded for treason a year later. 



:: Convince your king that he does not need anyone's approval {"position":"325,775","size":"100,100"}
By trying to convince the king that it was not necessary for him to engage in the jousting match to prove his masculine virility, you contradicted him. He took it as a sign of discourtesy. However, he decides to stay as you continue to promise him the arrival of a son, one that he has longed for.

Months later, you give birth to a healthy baby boy, the heir to the throne. You and your child are celebrated throughout the country. You are praised by the King, as you have made his wishes come true.

He recovered, but he suffered a leg wound that plagued him for the rest of his life. 
Due to this accident, you miscarried your second child, a son. This increased strife in the marriage partly due to your refusal to ignore your husband's philandering caused Henry to resent you. 

Your talents in courtly flirtations were unacceptable in a wife. Your enemies at court carried tales of your flirtations back to the king who became enraged at the thought of his wife sleeping with other men. 

Musician Mark Smeaton confessed under torture that he had slept with you and named four other men in his testimony, including the King's best friend, Henry Norris, as well as your own brother George Berlin.

On May 2nd 1536, after 2 ½ years of marriage, you were arrested and brought to the tower of London. There, you were tried in court for adultery, incest, and treason.
Although you pleaded your innocence and begged your husband for mercy, Henry decided that he was done with the woman he had once moved heaven and earth to win. 
During final days, you composed the poem “O death rock me asleep”.  The five men accused were beheaded  and two days later, you were also beheaded.  
Your body was placed in an arrow box and you were buried in an unmarked grave in the tower of London's chapel.

:: JaneSeymourStory {"position":"500,475","size":"100,100"}

Jane Seymour, the mother of Henry's heir, played a pivotal role in Tudor history. Your life was marked by both triumph and tragedy.

You were the daughter of knight Sir John Seymour and Margaret Wentworth. You were a proper English rose and as such were far less educated than your more continental predecessors, Catherine and Anne. You could read and write a little but were more expert at needlework and household management. You served as a lady in waiting to Queen Catherine, whom you loved dearly and later to Queen Anne. 

In February 1536, King Henry took notice of your beauty. He sent you a letter summoning you to the royal bed. What did you decide to do with the letter? 

[[Opened the letter]]

[[Return the letter]] 


:: Let Anne Boleyn take over the throne\  {"position":"0,1000","size":"100,100"}
Since you let Anne Boleyn take over the throne and faciliated the King's process  of bringing a new wife, Henry offered you better accommodations and permission to see your daughter Mary.

The birth of the new heir was celebrated throughout the country, bells were rung and fountains filled with wine, but the baby died after just 52 days of life. 

Knowing that the King was intensily looking for a heir, you had no choice but to keep conceiving. 

In 1513, while heavily pregnant, Henry appointed you as regent while he went to war in France. 
During your regency, King James the 4th of Scotland invaded Northern England.

To successfully perform your duty in the absence of your king, what did you choose to do next? 

[[Ride north in full armor as the head of the army]] 

[[Send the army alone]] 




:: Marry another nobleman {"position":"250,650","size":"100,100"}
As you chose to marry a nobleman other than King Henry VIII, you were not quite satisfied  with what this life had to offer, but you were at ease. Although other ladies in waiting took what what destined to be your spot at court, your knowledge of the French culture and experience eraned you a place on the French court. 

You thrived in France and made a name out for yourself. 



:: Opened the letter {"position":"575,600","size":"100,100"}
You decided to open the letter and accept the king's invitation. 
Too bad! You should have been more careful, the king went to bed with you and never made you queen of England. 

Although you got pregnant by him, a dauhter was not the gender that he was looing for. He took advantage and never established you at court. Your child was considered illegitimate. You fell into the trap.


:: Refuse and remain queen {"position":"125,1000","size":"100,100"}
Henry obsessed over a biblical passage from Leviticus which stated that it was a sin to marry your brother's widow and that such a couple would be childless, fled with Pope Clement VII for an annulment of your marriage, but the Pope was under siege from the holy Roman emperor, Charles V, who happened to be your nephew. 

You asked that the legality of your marriage be tried in a public court during which you proclaimed to everyone that your previous marriage to Prince Arthur had never been consummated and was therefore unlawful. 

This embarrassed and infuriated Henry and the Pope declined to dissolve the marriage. Henry used the Protestant movement to make himself head of the new Church of England. He dissolved the monasteries and enriched himself by looting their wealth. 

In 1531, you were exiled from court and your rooms were given to Anne. 
The king forbade you and your daughter Mary to see each other, but sympathetic servants secreted letters between you two.

You died at the age of 50. Your postmortem revealed a black growth on your heart. 
Anne and Henry both wore yellow when they received the news of your death which was seen as a vulgar insult. 
Henry did not attend your funeral as his first wife and he forbade your daughter Mary from mourning.



:: Remain isolated by yourself to fight the sickness {"position":"125,625","size":"100,100"}

You’re the only one who survived, and you are now a widow with an unclear future. You had to dismiss many of her servants and sell your jewelry for food. 

During this time of uncertainty you held the position of Spanish ambassador and was the first female ambassador in Europe. After seven years in limbo as a widow, you have now found the unthinkable opportunity of being the Queen of England. Therfore you: 


[[Marry King Henry VIII]]



:: Return the letter {"position":"450,600","size":"100,100"}
You returned the letter and emphasized your desire to make an honorable marriage. Your virtue further stirred the king's desire. You were gentle, meek and chaste. 

You came from a large family, a sure sign for the king that you could produce a large brood of sons. Due to the outbreaks of the plague in London, your public coronation had to be postpone. Since you were strict and conservative, you waited for your coronation to conceive.  

Your great love for Catherine of Aragon convinced Henry to invite Mary, his daughter by Catherine, back to court. You were particularly close to your stepdaughter. 

While Henry was in despair and doubted that he would ever father a son to survive, in early 1537, you became pregnant and spent the summer in confinement, protecting the fragile life of what you and Henry fervently hoped would be the coveted male heir.

In September, after three nights of Labor due to the baby being in the breech position, you delivered Henry's fondest wish, a healthy baby boy. Due to an infection contracted during the difficult childbirth, you died at 29 years old and had been queen for just 17 months. You were the only one of Henry's wives to receive a royal funeral. Henry wore black for 3 months following your death. 



:: Ride north in full armor as the head of the army {"position":"50,875","size":"100,100"}
Hoooray!! 
You won the battle of Flodden Field and gave a stirring speech. You have defeated the Scots! King James was killed in battle and you took his blood soaked coat as a trophy. 

However, a few days later you went into premature labor and delivered a stillborn son. 
The next year another stillbirth followed. At 30, your prayers were finally answered and you gave birth to a healthy child. However, your king was disappointed that it was a daughter, Mary, and not the heir he had hoped for.

As time passed, your king became interested in a more fertile and young woman, Anne, who will,hopefully, bring him a heir. It has been suggested to you to quietly retire to a nunnery to make room for Anne. 

[[Let Anne Boleyn take over the throne ]] 

[[Refuse and remain queen]] 


:: Send the army alone {"position":"175,875","size":"100,100"}
OH NO! 

You have sent the army alone, and without proper leadership, King James the 4th of Scotland has taken over most of  Northern England. Henry rushed back over and is extremely disappointed in you. 

You have proven the lack of authority and leadership. The entire country despises you, you are not a worthy queen have been demanded by the population to leave court. 

What a shame! A once influencital queen of England is sent back to her Spanish country as a failure.

:: Stay close to Prince Arthur despite the sickness {"position":"0,625","size":"100,100"}
Since you and your prince contracted the sweating sickness and decided to remain close to each other, you both passed away due to the lack of isolation. 


:: Wait further years for King Henry VII {"position":"350,625","size":"100,100"}
You passed up other chances to marry noblemen and had bet seven years of your life on winning the ultimate prize of being queen of England. You decided to not sleep with Henry until you could secure the crown and the legitimacy of your offspring. 

You slowly gained power securing titles for your kin and setting spies in the queen's household until you were at the center of court and Catherine was on the outskirts. 

In France, you learned enlightenment ideas about church reform, so you encouraged Henry to embrace the Protestant movement, split with Rome and declare himself head of the new Church of England. 

In November 1532, after a triumphant trip to France to secure alliance with your old friend, King Francis I, and with the divorce, you finally went to bed with the king.

The divorce was finalized in May and in September you gave birth to a healthy baby, but to Henry's consternation he had another daughter, Elizabeth.

Henry decided that if he couldn't prove his masculine virility by fathering a son, he would show it in the tilting yard. A costly decision...
